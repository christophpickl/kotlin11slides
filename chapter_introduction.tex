\frame{\frametitle{Kotlin 1.1 is out} 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Released on \textbf{1.3.2017} (about a year after \texttt{1.0})
    \item Current Version is \texttt{1.1.1} (bugfix release two weeks later)
    \item Fully backwards compatible with \texttt{1.0}
    % binary compatibility will always be given, but backwards compatibility? like in java for 20 years and carry on all the legacy stuff just to never break user code?
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Full commitment to \textbf{binary compatibility}
	\item Kotlin \texttt{2.0}? -- A possibility, not a plan! % containing bigger/non-backwards-compatible language changes
	\item Migration tools will be provided % want to integrate a "migration tool", which gets rid of warnings when using old language constructs
    \end{itemize}
    \item Currently working on \href{https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/04/kotlinnative-tech-preview-kotlin-without-a-vm/}{kotlin-native}
	    % (via LLVM) (seems kind like a problem to them to support JVM/JS/native, keep it to a minimum and add extensions)
    \item Gradle and Spring are happily using Kotlin \texttt{:)}
    % 30 people working on kotlin at jetbreains
  \end{itemize}

    \item \texttt{const val}s are now being \textbf{inlined} by the compiler

    \begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{kotlin.reflect} renamed to \texttt{kotlin.reflect.full}
	\item Old \textbf{deprecated} and to be removed with Kotlin \texttt{1.2}
	% classes moved from kotlin.reflect to kotlin.reflect.full (old are deprecated and will be deleted with kotlin 1.2)

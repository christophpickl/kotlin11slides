\frame{\frametitle{Kotlin 1.1 is out} 
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Released on 1.3.2017 (about a year after 1.0)

    \item Current 1.1.1 bugfix release two weeks later
    \item Fully backwards compatible with 1.0    
    % binary compatibility will always be given, but backwards compatibility? like in java for 20 years and carry on all the legacy stuff just to never break user code?
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Commitment to \textbf{binary compatibility}
	\item Kotlin \texttt{2.0}? -- A possibility, not a plan % containing bigger/non-backwards-compatible language changes
	\item Migration tools will be provided % want to integrate a "migration tool", which gets rid of warnings when using old language constructs
    \end{itemize}
    \item Currently working on \href{https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/04/kotlinnative-tech-preview-kotlin-without-a-vm/}{kotlin-native}
	    % (via LLVM) (seems kind like a problem to them to support JVM/JS/native, keep it to a minimum and add extensions)
    \item Gradle and Spring are using Kotlin
    % 30 people working on kotlin at jetbreains
  \end{itemize}

Requires some kts engine like: \texttt{kotlin-jsr223-local-example}
\begin{lstlisting}
val engine = ScriptEngineManager()
  .getEngineByExtension("kts") 
  ?: throw Exception("kts not supported!")

engine.eval("val x = 3")
println(engine.eval("x + 2"))  // 5
